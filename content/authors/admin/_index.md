I am an MS student in Mechanical Engineering at KAUST advised Prof. Aamir Farooq at the Chemical Kinetics and Laser Sensors Laboratory. Alongisde my work at KAUST, I primarily conducted my thesis at the National Research Council of Italy's Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnologies (CNR-IFN). I previously did my undergraduate studies at the University of Southern California, where I worked with Prof. Costas Synolakis and Prof. George Ban-Weiss. My research interests include laser diagnostics, optoelectronics, and atmospheric chemistry. 

At KAUST and the National Research Council of Italy, I’ve worked on developing high-speed Dual Comb Spectroscopy in the Mid-IR, laser diagnostics for HCN in the mid-IR (paper accepted as oral in PROCI 2022), and low-pressure stainless steel shocktube combustion.
